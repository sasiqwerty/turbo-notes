# what do I do?
we have no idea what we are doing and we are adding more stuff to this.. i wish i don't get the problem as often.. its not bad but its an irritant
- we have no idea
- but we are still doing something about it.
- I want do something about the mind.
- learn about the mind. learn about the things 
- its interesting the way we look at things. i love the ideas about learning and doing
- i would like to point out that we as humans are only as good as the persons next to us. we need to be stimulated. we cant just exist in space, we need to be social to be alive. this makes me wonder. what kind of stimulus can kill a human?
- what are the two extremes? what happens when hte mind is not allowed to choose. are we made to choose and pick what suits us best? or are we designed to follow a pack and think like a group or is it both? where am i going with this? 
- an uncontrolled thought is just as useless as doing nothing? not quite sure.
